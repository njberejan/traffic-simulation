# Traffic Simulation

This is a repository for the Traffic Simulation assignment from The Iron Yard in Durham, NC.

This assignment was a weekend assignment assigned in pairs. Stacy Zhao and I built this traffic simulation over the course of three days. The simulation had the following requirements:

* Drivers want to go up to 120 km/hr.
* The average car is 5 meters long.
* Drivers want at least a number of meters equal to their speed in meters/second between them and the next car.
* Drivers will accelerate 2 m/s up to their desired speed as long as they have room to do so.
* If another car is too close, drivers will match that car's speed until they have room again.
* If a driver would hit another car by continuing, they stop.
* Drivers will randomly (10% chance each second) slow by 2 m/s.
* This section of road is one lane going one way.

Please find our findings in the Jupyter Notebook file titled "TrafficSimulation.ipynb".
